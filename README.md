# TODO
1. calculate legend / colors / ranges in a smarter way with https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Quantitative-Scales
2. right now the all labels are hardcoded to "max dispatch distance'. Also, app assumes all data to be of that type. Modify app so it can take in multiple value types and allow user to choose which data type to visualize. 
3. allow alternate method of entering location : https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete
